Payment is due within 30 days after the date of the invoice (the “Due Date”) except that if Customer does not meet Suddenlink Media credit requirements, Customer must pay in advance of the order deadline. When possible, Suddenlink Media will include the Program’s duration, cost, airdate range, and time of airing according to the log of the cable system on which the Program is cablecast (“System”), but not the Program name. Invoices are deemed correct absent manifest error. Suddenlink Media may assess an interest charge equal to 1.25% per month (but not to exceed the maximum amount permitted	by law) on any balance unpaid after the Due Date. All invoiced amounts are payable to Suddenlink Media. Notwithstanding to whom invoices are sent,	Customer, including the advertiser, its agency and media placement service are jointly and severally obligated to pay Suddenlink Media by the Due Date and	until Suddenlink Media receives payment in full. Payment by the advertiser to its agency or media placement service, or payment by the agency to its media placement service, does not constitute payment to Suddenlink Media. Customer consents to Suddenlink Media’s disclosure of billing information, air time,	rates and any other information related to this Agreement to any third party directly related to the Program (including without limitation) disclosure of Suddenlink Media’s rates to agency clients.</span></td></tr></table>

Customer’s verbal cancellation or termination is not acceptable. If Customer terminates, cancels or fails to fulfill all of its obligations under this Contract, or if Suddenlink Media cancels or terminates this Agreement for cause for Programs already aired, Customer shall not receive any discounts and the amount due shall be calculated at the “earned rate” from the rate card then in effect, and Suddenlink Media may require Customer to pay for the airtime contracted. Suddenlink Media may cancel a Program or terminate this Agreement immediately if Customer fails to pay any invoice when due or breaches any other provision of this Contract. If Customer fails to pay any invoice in full by the Due Date and Suddenlink Media refers the account for collection, Customer agrees, for itself and its principal (if any), to pay all collection costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs. Upon a material breach by Suddenlink Media, Customer’s exclusive remedy shall be credit for substituted commercial or programming time of substantially equal value. Termination shall not in any way release Customer from its obligation to pay in full the amount due for programs cablecast before termination. Upon termination, all amounts owed by Customer shall become immediately due.</span></td></tr></table>

If System does not cablecast part or all of any Program at any stipulated time, System may cablecast the Program at subsequent times. In such event, Suddenlink Media will notify Customer in advance, if reasonably possible, or within a reasonable time after the substitution. Suddenlink Media’s liability for failure to cablecast a Program shall not exceed the amount paid by Customer under this Agreement for cablecast of the Program and in no event is Customer entitled to a cash refund or monetary damages. Except as set forth in Section 2, if the Program is not cablecast by Suddenlink Media, Customer is not required to pay for the cablecast, or is entitled to a refund of any amount already paid for the Program. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Contract, if a Program airs for at least ninety percent (90%) of the time ordered, or within five (5) minutes of a requested time, Customer agrees to pay in full. In the event of a mechanical failure, equipment problem, utility outage, technical problem, act of God, accident, fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, lock-out, strike or other labor dispute, war, terrorist act, earthquake, explosion or any other event beyond the reasonable control of Suddenlink Media (a "Force Majeure Event"), Suddenlink Media or System shall not be liable for any failure to perform. If a Force Majeure Event affects Suddenlink Media’s performance under this Contract, Customer hereby agrees to pay in full once an average of seventy percent (70%) of the System’s cable nodes are functioning in any twenty-four (24) hour period in a way that gives the majority of subscribers in the applicable area the ability to receive the Service on which the Program airs.</span></td></tr></table>

Customer shall deliver Program material and cablecast scheduling instructions to Suddenlink Media before the System’s established deadlines and no less than two (2) full business days before the scheduled cablecast. If Customer fails to meet these deadlines or to use the time contracted for, Suddenlink Media may substitute another program or announcement at Customer’s expense and Customer shall remain liable for the full amount contracted for herein. All Programs are subject to the approval (before, during or after the scheduled run of any Programs) of Suddenlink Media, System and any programming service on which the Program is to be cablecast (“Service”). Suddenlink Media may refuse at any time to cablecast a Program in all or parts of the area serviced by the System that Suddenlink Media, System, or Service determines, in its sole discretion, to be illegal, unsatisfactory, unsuitable, contrary to the public interest, or contrary to its business interests. This Contract does not obligate Suddenlink Media to cablecast any Program, sound recordings or material inconsistent with the policies or practices of Suddenlink Media, System or Service. If any Program is unsatisfactory, Suddenlink Media shall make reasonable efforts to notify Customer. Unless Customer or its agency (if any) furnishes satisfactory material 72 hours before the scheduled cablecast time, Suddenlink Media may at its option: (i) substitute its own program at no charge to Customer, (ii) terminate this Contract without liability or charge to either party, and/or (iii) hold Customer liable for all time reserved. Suddenlink Media and System may solicit and cablecast programs or announcements that compete with Customer’s business, products or services. Suddenlink Media will not return tapes and other material provided by Customer unless: (i) Customer requested their return in this Contract, and (ii) Customer picks up the material at its own expense within thirty (30) days after the last cablecast. Otherwise, Suddenlink Media or System may dispose of all material including materials created by Suddenlink Media for Customer. Video shot by Suddenlink Media for Customer may be used by Suddenlink Media in commercials or Programs for other customers and will not necessarily be retained by Suddenlink Media unless required on the face of this Contract. Suddenlink Media and/or System may deliver copies of Program material to any third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order or similar judicial process without notice to, or consent of, Customer.</span></td></tr></table>

Suddenlink Media may disclose the terms of this Contract to potential buyers, lenders and investors of the System. Customer may not transfer or assign this Contract, including the rights hereunder, without Suddenlink Media’s prior written consent. Suddenlink Media may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Contract without obtaining Customer’s consent or providing Customer notice. If all or part of any System is sold, Suddenlink Media reserves the right to partition any Customer order between a sold System and an unsold System, as determined by Suddenlink Media in its sole discretion. Suddenlink Media is not required to cablecast a Program for any advertiser other than the Customer named herein or for any product or service other than as specified herein. Failure of either party to enforce any provision hereof shall not be construed as a general relinquishment or waiver of that or any other provision. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 shall survive the cancellation, expiration or termination of this Contract. The obligations of all parties are subject to the terms of applicable licenses and to federal, state and local laws and regulations. No change or modification to this Contract shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. The laws of the state where Suddenlink Media’s authorized representative maintains its office, without regard to the conflict or choice-of-law provisions thereof shall govern this Contract. Customer agrees, for itself and on behalf of its principal (if any), that the venue in any legal proceeding shall be the county where such office is located. Under its Blanket Music Licensing Agreements with certain music licensing organizations, Suddenlink Media is required to collect certain information regarding musical works in programming carried over the System. Within ten (10) days of a request by Suddenlink Media, Customer must supply an accurate and complete listing of the following information regarding music in its programming: Title, Composer, Performing Artist, Publisher and Duration. If Customer fails to timely supply this information, Suddenlink Media may at its option immediately terminate this Agreement and/or suspend the carriage of Customer’s programming. This Agreement is a blanket agreement covering all advertising orders placed by Customer. Unless another agreement is signed, this Agreement will automatically govern Customer’s future advertising orders as if Customer and Suddenlink Media had signed a new agreement for each new order, and will continue in effect until terminated pursuant to Section 2 above. (i) Customer’s placement of advertising schedules, programming or other materials and Suddenlink Media’s cablecasting of same; or (ii) Customer’s signature on this Contract, constitutes Customer’s acceptance of all Contract terms and condition. By placing an order with Suddenlink Media, Customer represents that it is not legally prohibited or restrained from entering into this Contract, and that doing so will not violate the rights of any third party.</span></td></tr></table>
