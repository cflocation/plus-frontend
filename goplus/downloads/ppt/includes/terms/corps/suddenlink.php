When possible, Suddenlink Media will include the Program’s duration, cost, airdate range, and time of airing according to the log of the cable system on which the Program is cablecast (“System”), but not the Program name. Invoices are deemed correct absent manifest error.Suddenlink Media may assess an interest charge equal to 1.25% per month (but not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law) on any balance unpaid after the Due Date. All invoiced amounts are payable to Suddenlink Media. Notwithstanding to whom invoices are sent, Customer, including the advertiser, its agency and media placement service are jointly and severally obligated to pay Suddenlink Media by the Due Date and until Suddenlink Media receives payment in full. Payment by the advertiser to its agency or media placement service, or payment by the agency to its media placement service, does not constitute payment to Suddenlink Media. Customer consents to Suddenlink Media’s disclosure of billing information, air time, rates and any other information related to this Agreement to any third party directly related to the Program (including without limitation) disclosure of Suddenlink Media’s rates to agency clients.')		  ->getFont()		  ->setBold(true)		  ->setSize(6)		  ->setColor(new PHPPowerPoint_Style_Color('FFFFFFFF'));	$cell->getActiveParagraph()->getAlignment()->setHorizontal(PHPPowerPoint_Style_Alignment::HORIZONTAL_CENTER);	$cell = $row->nextCell();	$cell->setWidth(20);	$cell = $row->nextCell();	$cell->setWidth(440);	$cell->createTextRun('6 .
