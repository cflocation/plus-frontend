Invoices are deemed correct absent manifest error. Suddenlink Media may assess an interest charge equal to 1.25% per month (but not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law) on any balance unpaid after the Due Date. All invoiced amounts are payable to Suddenlink Media. Notwithstanding to whom invoices are sent, Customer, including the advertiser, its agency and media placement service are jointly and severally obligated to pay Suddenlink Media by the Due Date and until Suddenlink Media receives payment in full. Payment by the advertiser to its agency or media placement service, or payment by the agency to its media placement service, does not constitute payment to Suddenlink Media.
